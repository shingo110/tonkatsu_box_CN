# Import layer

Shared infrastructure for importing a user's library from third-party services
(Steam, IGDB lists, Trakt, Kinorium, RetroAchievements, MyAnimeList, AniList, …).

The layer follows **ports & adapters**: one port (`ImportSource`) with many
adapters (one per source, under `sources/`). The reusable domain pieces —
collection writing, TMDB matching, rate-limit retry — live at the root and are
**injected** into adapters, not inherited.

> Status: every importer — **Kinorium, Steam, IGDB lists, Trakt, Simkl,
> RetroAchievements, MyAnimeList and AniList** — is now an adapter on this
> layer. The `.xcoll` /
> `.xcollx` collection-file import (`core/services/import_service.dart`) stays
> separate by design: it restores a full collection snapshot rather than
> resolving titles against an external catalog.

## Layers

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `import_source.dart` | The port: `ImportSource` + `ImportOptions`. Each adapter implements `import(options) → UniversalImportResult` with progress callbacks. |
| `import_progress.dart` | `ImportProgress` / `ImportStage` / `ImportProgressCallback` — the progress vocabulary shared by the layer and the `.xcoll` importer (which re-exports it for its own callers). |
| `import_writer.dart` | Shared write-side: resolve-or-create the collection, batch-insert new items, selectively update existing ones (per-source merge policy via a closure), batch-write wishlist fallbacks. Returns the resulting row ids (`itemIdsByKey` / `idFor`) so adapters can act on written items — tags, side-tables — without re-reading the collection. Goes through the **repositories**, never the DAOs. |
| `tmdb_matcher.dart` | Matches a title against TMDB by name (original + localized query, year then no-year, pick-best, animation-by-genre). For sources whose rows carry no TMDB id. |
| `rate_limited_retry.dart` | Source-agnostic exponential backoff; the caller decides what counts as a rate limit. |
| `media_cache_writer.dart` | `MediaCacheWriter.upsertAll` — one batched upsert per media table for any mix of resolved models; the DAOs stay the only writers. |
| `title_lookup/` | Name-based lookup for rows that carry no id: `LookupChains` (per-type source order over the API clients, keyed sources skipped without a key) and `TitleResolver` (walks the chain, strict "exactly one" via `classifyTitleMatches`; an ambiguous hit stops the walk). Unlike `TmdbMatcher`, it never settles for the first result. |
| `sources/<name>/` | One adapter per source, each with its own `README.md`. |

## What is shared vs per-source

**Shared (here):** collection resolve/create, batch item write with re-sync
change detection, written-row ids, wishlist fallback (import tag + text dedup),
per-type tallies, progress vocabulary, rate-limit retry, TMDB-by-name matching.

**Per-source (in the adapter):** input parsing/fetching (file vs username vs
token), the matching strategy (TMDB vs IGDB vs AniList — rows may already carry
ids), the re-sync merge policy, and media-cache upsert (type-specific DAOs).

## Adding a new source

1. Create `sources/<name>/` with a `README.md`.
2. Define `<Name>ImportOptions extends ImportOptions`.
3. Implement `<Name>ImportService implements ImportSource`:
   - parse/fetch raw entries;
   - resolve them (a matcher such as `TmdbMatcher`, or ids already on the rows);
   - upsert the fetched media into the cache via the relevant DAOs;
   - build `ImportCandidate`s and call `ImportWriter.writeItems`;
   - send unmatched titles to `ImportWriter.writeWishlist` with
     `buildImportTag(displayName)`;
   - return a `UniversalImportResult`.
4. Add a Riverpod provider wiring the repositories, the API client, and the
   shared helpers.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → "Import layer" for the high-level picture.
The user-facing contract of the custom cards file and its source lookup is
