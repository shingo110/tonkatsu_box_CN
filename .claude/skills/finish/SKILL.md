description: End-of-task pipeline — simplify review, double review, tests, single analyze+test gate, changelog/docs. Use when you've finished implementing a task and want to harden it before committing. Does NOT commit or push; the user must ask explicitly.
---

# Finish Pipeline

Run this **once** at the end of a task. The pipeline merges the old simplify / double-review / full-coverage-tests / changelog-docs skills into a single flow with a **single** analyze+test gate at the end.

## Ground rules

- Collect the diff once at Phase 0; reuse it across phases.
- Do NOT run `flutter analyze` or `flutter test` between phases — only Phase 5 runs them.
- Do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do NOT create new `.md` files unless the user explicitly asks.
- Fix findings inline within the phase that surfaced them; don't park lists of "TODO later".

## Comment style (enforced project-wide)

- **English only.** No Russian / Cyrillic in `///`, `//`, or `/* */` blocks. UI strings stay in `.arb`; this rule is about code comments.
- **Only WHY, never WHAT.** A comment exists to explain a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround, a non-obvious algorithm choice, or a refactor note. Names and types already cover *what*.
- **No comment > bad comment.** If you can't say something the code can't, delete the comment.
- **Hard cap: 2 lines.** No comment block (`//`, `///`, or `/* */`) may exceed 2 consecutive lines — anywhere, including dartdoc on public API. If it doesn't fit in 2 lines, cut it until it does.
- **No file-header comments.** A file never starts with a comment block describing what the file is — the path and the first declaration already say that. Delete top-of-file comments in every new or touched file.
- **No section dividers, no banners.** `// ===== Foo =====` and `// --- bar ---` are noise — drop them.
- **No TODOs without a tracker reference.** A bare `// TODO: fix this` rots; tie it to an issue or remove it.
- **Translate, don't preserve.** When touching a file with Russian comments, translate the salvageable ones to English and delete the rest as part of the same diff.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Snapshot

```bash
git status --short
git diff HEAD
```

Enumerate changed files once. If the diff is empty, stop with "nothing to finalise".

### Phase 1 — Simplify

Review new/changed code from three independent angles. **This phase is self-contained — do not delegate to a built-in `/simplify` skill, which may not exist in every Claude Code version.** Run the review yourself using these three lenses:

1. **Reuse**
   - Search the codebase for existing utilities, DAO methods, helpers, or constants that could replace newly written code. Common locations: `lib/shared/`, sibling files of the changed file, existing DAOs.
   - Flag new functions that duplicate existing functionality.
   - Flag inline logic that could use an existing helper (string manipulation, path handling, type guards, platform checks).

2. **Quality**
   - Redundant state, cached values that could be derived.
   - Parameter sprawl (adding N-th param instead of restructuring).
   - Copy-paste with slight variation → unify with shared abstraction.
   - Leaky abstractions, stringly-typed code where enums/consts exist.
   - Unnecessary wrapper widgets/Boxes that add no layout value.
   - Nested conditionals 3+ levels (flatten with early returns, lookup tables, if/else-if cascade).
   - Unnecessary comments explaining WHAT (delete; keep only WHY for hidden constraints, subtle invariants, workarounds).

3. **Efficiency**
   - Redundant computations, duplicate network/DB calls, N+1 patterns.
   - Missed concurrency: independent `await`s in sequence → `Future.wait`.
   - Hot-path bloat (startup, per-render, per-request).
   - No-op store updates in polling loops / event handlers (add change-detection guard).
   - TOCTOU anti-pattern (pre-checking existence then operating) → operate directly and handle the error.
   - Unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, event listener leaks.
   - Reading whole files when a slice is enough.

**For large diffs** (≥5 changed files or ≥300 lines), dispatch the three angles as parallel `Agent` sub-tasks (`subagent_type: Explore`) in a single message — each agent gets the full diff and reports its findings in ≤300 words. Then aggregate and fix. On small diffs, review all three angles yourself inline.

Fix actionable issues. Skip false positives — don't argue, just move on. Out-of-scope issues (pre-existing cruft in untouched files) get noted in the final report, not fixed here.

### Phase 2 — Double review

**R1 — correctness**
- Logic, edge cases, strict typing (no `dynamic`, no `var` in public API, `final` / `const` where possible, nullable handled via `?.` / `??` / checks).
- Error handling (no silent failures).
- **SharedPreferences per-profile rule**: user-specific keys MUST be suffixed with `'${profileId}'` read via a getter (not cached in a field — profile can change). Global keys (API creds, theme, language) are the exception.
- **Cross-platform**: no hardcoded Windows paths, `package:path` for joins, `Platform.isX` branches fall through for all supported OS (Windows + Linux + Android), Windows-only plugins (`webview_windows`) gated by `kVgMapsEnabled`.
- **New enum value propagation** (only if the change adds a `MediaType` / `CanvasItemType` value): run `flutter analyze` to surface exhaustive-switch errors across `canvas_view.dart`, `all_items_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `export_service.dart`, `import_service.dart`, plus filter chips, `CollectionStats` counts, `collectedXxxIdsProvider`, and all localisation keys (`unknown*`, `allItems*`, `collectionFilter*`, `mediaType*`, `searchSource*`).
- **DB migrations (any schema change)**: `create*Table` in `schema.dart` is shared between fresh installs (`createAll`) and the historical migration that first created the table — so any column or index baked into a `create*Table` is **also** re-applied when an old DB jumps many versions in one upgrade (the create runs with today's schema, then the historical `ALTER` / `CREATE INDEX` runs on top). A raw statement then throws `duplicate column name` / `index already exists` and the whole upgrade rolls back, leaving the app frozen on the splash. Rules:
  - **Adding a column**: update the relevant `create*Table` in `schema.dart` (fresh installs need it) **and** add a new migration that calls `Migration.addColumnIfAbsent(db, table, column, columnDef)` — **never** a bare `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`.
  - **Creating an index inside a migration**: always `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` (and `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`).
  - **Never** retro-edit or "freeze" an existing migration to dodge a collision, and never split `create*Table` into per-version copies. The idempotent ALTER / `IF NOT EXISTS` index is the sanctioned pattern — it's always valid to apply boldly because it's a no-op when the target already exists.
  - Bump `version` in `_initDatabase()` and register the migration in `MigrationRegistry.all`.

**R2 — quality and performance**
- Readability (function size, single responsibility, self-documenting names).
- Duplication (shared logic extracted).
- Memory / leaks (subscriptions cancelled, controllers disposed).
- Flutter specifics (`const` widgets, `ListView.builder` for long lists, no object creation in `build()`).

**R2b — enum single source of truth (mandatory)**

No raw string / number literal in production code may duplicate a value, `.name`, `.key`, or display label that an **enum already owns**. If a concept is modelled by an enum (`MediaType`, `ItemStatus`, `DataSource`, `CanvasItemType`, `CollectionSortMode`, `ExportFormat`, `AnimeMangaTitleLanguage`, `NavTab`, `DiscoverSectionId`, …), every read / write / compare / label / default MUST go through it — `EnumX.value`, `EnumX.name`, `EnumX.key`, `EnumX.label`, `localizedLabel(l)`, `fromString` / `tryFromString` — **never** a bare `'game'`, `'completed'`, `'mangabaka'`, `'IGDB'`, `'romaji'`, `'light'`. This is doubly non-negotiable for values that already exist in an enum: the literal must live in exactly one place, the enum.

How to check: for each enum the diff touches (and its close neighbours), grep its literal values and labels across `lib/`. The only non-exception home should be the enum definition. Also grep the diff itself for quoted strings that echo an enum member — new hardcodes are the common regression.

Fix: replace the literal with the enum accessor (import the enum where needed). If it is a default parameter value (needs `const`), expose a `static const` on the enum and reference that (e.g. `AnimeMangaTitleLanguage.defaultId`). If several call sites hardcode a per-source string (`groupId`, `apiName`, `sourceName`), derive it once from the owning enum (`DataSource.key` / `DataSource.label`) and delete the overrides / parallel maps.

Allowed exceptions (do NOT flag these):
- The enum's own definition file — the single place the literal lives.
- DB migrations (`lib/core/database/migrations/`) and `create*Table` DDL in `schema.dart` — historical / storage strings, immutable.
- Raw SQL string bodies — leave the literal; reference the enum in a comment if helpful.
- **External-API mapping** — the provider's own tokens on the far side of a translation boundary (TMDB `movie`/`tv`, AniList `ANIME`/`MANGA`, Kitsu / MAL / Trakt / Kinorium, search-filter API values, AniList JSON keys like `romaji`). These are not the enum's namespace.
- Generated l10n (`app_localizations*.dart`) and `.arb` — localisation resources.
- A short badge `label` that legitimately differs from a full display name — e.g. `DataSource.steamGridDb.label` is `'SGDB'` but the credits screen shows `'SteamGridDB'`; these are different concepts, do not force one into the other. Same for a per-tab `SearchSource.id` (`'movies'`, `'manga'`) which is a media/tab identifier, not the provider name.

**R2c — model purity (mandatory)**

`lib/shared/models/**` stays pure Dart: no `package:flutter`, no `dart:ui`, no l10n imports — direct or transitive through other model files. Models hold data only (ARGB colors as `int`, hex colors as `String`, stored enum values); presentation (`Color`, `IconData`, localized labels) lives in `extension <Model>Ui` files under `lib/shared/constants/*_ui.dart`, hex⇄Color codecs in `lib/shared/utils/color_hex.dart`. Rationale: the model layer is slated for extraction into a pure-Dart core package shared with the selfhost server, and `dart:ui` does not exist in a plain Dart VM.

How to check (must return nothing):

```bash
grep -rln "package:flutter\|dart:ui\|l10n/" lib/shared/models/
```

Fix: move the offending getter/method into the model's `*_ui.dart` extension (create it if missing), store the raw value in the model, and add the extension import at call sites. Never "fix" by re-adding a Flutter type to a model.

**R2c-rpc — regenerate the RPC layer (mandatory when the diff touches a DAO or a model)**

`packages/core/tool/generate_rpc.dart` emits the browser-side stubs, the
per-DAO dispatchers and the dispatch table from the DAO signatures **and every
model those signatures reach**. So a field added to `Collection`, `Game`,
`CollectionItem` — anything a DAO returns — changes the wire format while
changing no signature at all: nothing in the type system sees it, and the
stale stub silently drops the field.

If the diff touches `packages/core/lib/database/dao/**` or
`packages/core/lib/models/**`, regenerate and commit the result:

```bash
cd packages/core && dart run tool/generate_rpc.dart
```

Do not hand-edit anything under `packages/core/lib/rpc/generated/`. The Phase 5
gate proves it: `packages/core/test/rpc/generated_up_to_date_test.dart`
regenerates in memory and diffs against the committed files, so a forgotten run
fails `dart test`.

New wire shape the generator refuses (`No wire rule for X`)? Teach it a rule in
`_encode` / `_decode` and cover it with a round-trip test in
`packages/core/test/rpc/` — never work around it by degrading the DAO signature.

**R2d — web readiness (mandatory)**

The project is headed for a selfhost web build: same branch, web as one more build target, DAO calls become the client↔server RPC boundary, external APIs go through a server proxy. New code must not create rework for that plan. Check the diff for:

- **No new unguarded `dart:io`** (`Platform.is*`, `File`, `Directory`, `Process`) in `lib/features/` or `lib/shared/`. Platform branching goes through `platform_features.dart` flags; intrinsic file I/O (export/import, disk cache) stays behind existing service boundaries or a flag so web can stub it. `dart:io` inside `lib/core/services/` that a web build will conditionally replace is acceptable; a `Platform.isWindows` inline in a widget is not.
- **DB access only through DAO methods.** No raw SQL or `db.rawQuery` outside `lib/core/database/dao/` — every DAO method is a future RPC endpoint, so the UI/provider layer must call `dao.method(...)`, never touch the `Database` handle. New DAO method signatures must be JSON-serialisable at the boundary: arguments and returns built from primitives, enums (sent as `.name`/`.value`), `DateTime`, models with `toDb`/`fromDb`, and collections thereof — no callbacks other than the established `_getDatabase` injection, no `Database`/`Transaction` parameters in public signatures, no returning raw `Map` rows where a typed record/model is feasible.
- **External API calls stay inside `lib/core/api/` clients** (Dio) — never a one-off `http`/`Dio` call from a widget or provider; the proxy phase swaps base URLs in one place.
- **`dart:ui` / `package:flutter` stay out of models and pure-logic layers** (overlaps R2c) — the server imports these files in a plain Dart VM.
- **Web-incompatible plugins** (`webview_windows`, window management, gamepad, Discord RPC, file pickers) — any new usage must sit behind a `platform_features.dart` flag, not a bare platform check.

Fix: route the platform check through a flag, move raw SQL into a DAO method, move the HTTP call into the API client. Flag (don't silently accept) anything that would force the selfhost phases to redesign the new code.

**R2e — theme awareness (mandatory)**

The app has switchable themes (`AppPalette.dark` / `AppPalette.sakura`, selected in Settings → Appearance). Every color decision must survive both a near-black and a near-white background. Check the diff for:

- **No hardcoded colors in UI code.** No `Colors.*` (except `Colors.transparent`) and no inline `Color(0x...)` in widgets — every color goes through an `AppColors` token, which reads the active palette. Semantic tokens for the common traps: over poster/image art use `AppColors.scrim` (+`withAlpha` at the call site) and `AppColors.onOverlay`; text/icons on brand-filled controls use `AppColors.onBrand`; drop shadows `AppColors.shadow`; modal barriers `AppColors.barrier` or `scrim.withAlpha(...)`. Never assume "white text reads fine" — the background may be `#FDF2F4`.
- **Allowed exceptions** (do NOT flag): external-brand colors (`platform_ui.dart`, `service_badges.dart`, RA/Discord brand constants, the settings capsule `_k*Color`s), color-picker swatch palettes (user content), luminance-based black/white contrast picks (`luminance > 0.5 ? black : white`), pure alpha masks (`[white, transparent]` shader gradients).
- **No cached theme colors.** Never store anything derived from `AppColors.*` / `AppTypography.*` / `MediaTypeTheme.*` in a `static final`, `static const`, top-level `final`, or a const constructor default — the value freezes on the palette active at first access and survives a theme switch. Use a getter (`static Color get x => AppColors.y;`) or compute inside `build()`. Grep the diff for `static final`/top-level `final` whose initializer mentions those classes.
- **New color = new palette entry.** A genuinely new color goes into `AppPalette` as a field with a value for **every** palette (dark AND sakura — pick a sakura shade with real contrast on the light background, usually a darkened variant), plus a delegating `AppColors` getter. Never add a color that exists in only one theme.
- **New screens/widgets** in the diff: reason through (or run) both themes — what does every used token render to in sakura? Pale-on-light and white-on-white are the recurring regressions.

**R3 — localisation**
- Every UI string uses `S.of(context).key` or `final S l = S.of(context);`.
- ARB: every key exists in **every** `lib/l10n/app_*.arb` locale file (glob them — the set grows over time: en, ru, zh, …); placeholder names match across all of them; Russian plurals use ICU `=0` / `=1` / `few` / `other`. Languages without plural forms (e.g. Chinese) may render an ICU-plural key as a single flat string (`{count} 项`) as long as they keep the same placeholders.
- Enum labels via `localizedLabel(S l)` extensions, not raw `.displayLabel`.
- Status labels adapt to media type (Playing for games, Watching for movies/TV).
- Allowed English: debug screens, `debugPrint`, model field names, enum `.name`, test assertions.

### Phase 3 — Tests for new code

**Goal: useful tests, not coverage theatre.** 100% line/branch coverage is *not* the target. Aim for tests that break only when real behaviour breaks — and that would catch a future regression you'd actually care about.

Every test must pull its weight in one of three buckets:

**1. UI doesn't silently break**
   - Widget renders without exceptions (`expect(tester.takeException(), isNull)`).
   - Critical flows work: tap handlers fire the right callback, navigation happens, conditional widgets show/hide on state change, lists render the right item count.
   - **Do NOT test** colours, text labels, icons, font sizes, padding, border radius, widget types used purely for styling (e.g. `find.byType(Container)`). Design changes must not break tests. Localised string values — same rule: assert that *some* text appears, not that it equals a specific string.
   - Data-driven text that flows from model → UI is fair game (`expect(find.text(collection.name), findsOneWidget)` is OK; `expect(find.text('Collections'), findsOneWidget)` for a static title is not).

**2. Logic is verified reliably**
   - For every public method / function: happy path + each meaningful branch (if/else, switch cases, early returns, error paths).
   - Edge cases the change actually cares about: empty input, null, boundaries, concurrent-state races where relevant. Skip defensive null-guards that can't trigger in practice.
   - Model serialisation round-trips (`fromJson`/`toJson`, `fromDb`/`toDb`) when the change touches models.
   - `copyWith` semantics when a new field is added.

**3. Method calls at the boundary are verified**
   - When the change orchestrates multiple collaborators (DAO, repository, API client, provider), use `verify(() => mock.method(args)).called(N)` to pin down that the right method was called with the right args, the right number of times.
   - Use `verifyNever` to assert negative-space guarantees (e.g. "no tag remap when sourceTagId is null").
   - Use `captureAny()` to inspect complex payloads (e.g. "the cloned row has `tag_id: null`").

**Infrastructure rules (non-negotiable):**
- `import '../../helpers/test_helpers.dart'` — reuse mocks from `test/helpers/mocks.dart`, builders from `builders.dart`, fallbacks via `registerAllFallbacks()` in `setUpAll`.
- Mock/builder will be used in ≥2 files → add it to helpers. Unique to one test → declare locally.
- Widget tests use `tester.pumpApp()`, not a hand-rolled `ProviderScope` + `MaterialApp`.
- Naming: `should [expected result] when [condition]`.

**Self-check before finishing a test:** *"If someone changed the design tomorrow (colours, labels, layout) — would this test fail?"* If yes, and the change wasn't a logic change, the test is overfitted. Remove or relax it.

### Phase 4 — Changelog + docs

**CHANGELOG.md** — `[Unreleased]` section, Keep a Changelog version headers (`## [Unreleased]` / `## [X.Y.Z] - date`) with Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed sub-sections; inside each sub-section, entries follow [GNU Change Log style](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html).

Entry structure — three parts separated by blank lines:

1. **Topic line** — one bolded sentence summarising the change (past-tense or imperative, like a commit subject).
2. **Body** (optional, 1–3 sentences) — what the feature or fix does now, plain prose, no file paths. Skip if the topic line is self-explanatory. **Never explain WHY or the history**: no rationale ("so the counter stops...", "which is why..."), no diagnosis of the old bug ("the cache file was named after..."), no before/after narration. **Never compare with or reference another source or app** ("like TMDB has", "the way books do", "same pattern as X"). State the end behaviour, full stop.
3. **File list** — bulleted index of affected files in the form `* path/to/file.dart (ClassName.methodName, OtherSymbol): what changed`. Use full paths from the repo root and full symbol names (never abbreviate, never group with `{foo,bar}` syntax — every symbol must be greppable on its own). Several files with identical descriptions can be combined on one line separated by commas. A file with no specific symbol worth naming can be listed as `* path/to/file.dart: what changed`.

Rules:
- English entries. No Russian abbreviations or Cyrillic shorthand in English prose (write "right-click", not "ПКМ"; "left-click", not "ЛКМ"). Russian strings quoted as UI labels ("«Желаемое»") are fine — that's data, not prose.
- Separate unrelated topics with a blank line (already enforced by Markdown list spacing).
- **Unreleased consolidation**: when enhancing or fixing something already in `[Unreleased]` that was never released, update the existing entry in place — don't add a separate Fixed / Changed bullet. Users should see the final state, not the development history. This applies to the topic line, body, and the file list alike.
- **Fixed entries are for released features only.** A Fixed / Changed entry may exist only when the thing it fixes shipped in a past release. A fix or tweak to a feature introduced in the same `[Unreleased]` cycle ("added music, then two tasks later fixed something in it") must never appear as its own entry — fold the final behaviour into the feature's entry, or drop it entirely if the feature text already covers it.
- If a single topic spans many unrelated files (≈30+), it probably bundles several changes — split into multiple topic entries rather than letting one file list balloon.

Example:

```
- **Expand AniList search filters for anime and manga**

  Anime tab grows from 2 filters to 4; manga from 2 to 4. Multi-select
  genre uses OR match. Year filter uses `startDate` bounds so it works
  for older and cancelled titles where `seasonYear` is null.

  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi.browseAnime, AniListApi.browseManga):
    Change `$genre: String` → `$genres: [String]`; add `$format`, `$status`,
    `$startDateGreater`, `$startDateLesser` GraphQL vars.
  * lib/features/search/filters/anilist_anime_format_filter.dart
    (AniListAnimeFormatFilter), anilist_manga_status_filter.dart
    (AniListMangaStatusFilter): New.
  * lib/features/search/filters/manga_format_filter.dart (MangaFormatFilter.options):
    Limit to MANGA, NOVEL, ONE_SHOT — MANHWA / MANHUA / LIGHT_NOVEL were
    rejected by AniList's `MediaFormat` enum.
```

**docs/** — update only if the change actually affects them:

| File | When to touch |
|------|---------------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | New layer, major module, or shift in patterns. Keep it a high-level map — do NOT add per-file tables or SQL schema dumps |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Changes to development process |
| `CODESTYLE.md` | New lint rules, typing conventions |
| `COMMITS.md` | Changes to commit conventions |
| `RCOLL_FORMAT.md` | Changes to `.xcoll` / `.xcollx` export format |
| `GAMEPAD.md` | New focusable widgets, navigation rules |
| `SNACKBAR.md` | Changes to `context.showSnack()` API or types |

Language per file: most are Russian. Keep each in its current language. Preserve formatting — make targeted edits, don't rewrite.

### Phase 5 — Gate (single run)

```bash
flutter analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings
flutter test
cd packages/core && dart test
cd server && dart test
```

`packages/core` and `server` resolve separately, so a change there is invisible
to `flutter test` — run all four.

Follow the failure-recovery rules below. When green, STOP — report what changed and wait for an explicit commit/push instruction.

## Failure recovery

| Failure | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Analyzer fails** | Fix inline. Re-run analyzer only. Do not re-do earlier phases. |
| **Test fails — a test I just wrote** | Fix the test (wrong mock stub, missing fallback, wrong assertion). Re-run tests only. |
| **Test fails — existing test** | **Default: the test is right, the production code is wrong.** Do not edit the test yet. First, re-read the test and the code paths it covers. Ask: *"Was this specific behaviour something I deliberately changed as part of the task?"* Answer this honestly before touching anything. **→ If NO** (surprise failure, behaviour change you didn't plan): back to **Phase 1** — the code is wrong, fix the code, then Phase 3 for the affected area, then re-gate. **→ If YES** (the old assertion contradicts the intended new behaviour, and the new behaviour is in the spec/user request): update the test, rerun tests. Document the behaviour change in the final report so the user sees what shifted. **If unsure, default to NO.** |
| **Review (Phase 1-2) needs a code change** | Fix inline. If the fix touches production code (not just comments/docstrings), add/update tests in Phase 3 before re-gating. |
| **R3 reveals missing ARB keys** | Add the key to **every** `lib/l10n/app_*.arb` locale file (glob them, don't assume a fixed set), run `flutter gen-l10n`, re-run analyzer. |
| **`generated_up_to_date_test` fails** | The RPC layer is stale — regenerate (`dart run tool/generate_rpc.dart` in `packages/core`) and commit the output. Never edit the generated files to make it pass. |
| **Flaky test** | Retry the affected test file once via `flutter test path/to/test.dart`. If it still fails, treat it as real. |

**Anti-loop rule** — if the same error has been attempted twice with different fixes and still fails, STOP and report to the user. Do not keep hacking.

**Scope creep** — unrelated issues discovered during review (pre-existing bugs, cruft in untouched files) are NOT fixed here. Note them in the final report; user decides.

## Report format

One line per phase as it completes, e.g.:

```
Phase 1 simplify: 2 fixes (removed redundant setItemTag write, inlined unused helper).
Phase 2 R1 critical fix: SQLite LOWER() doesn't handle Cyrillic → switched to Dart toLowerCase. R2/R3 clean.
Phase 3 tests: 20 new tests across 3 files, all green.
Phase 4 changelog: 1 Changed entry; no docs/ touched.
Phase 5 gate: analyze clean, 4776 tests passed.
Risk: Low — re-downloadable cache only, no permanent data loss; affects the Settings cache button.
Status: ready for commit. Awaiting explicit /commit.
```

## Phase 6 — Risk assessment & impact (always, after the gate)

A green gate proves the code compiles and the tests pass — it does **not** prove the change is safe to put in front of a real user. Close every run with a short, honest risk assessment so the user can decide whether to ship. Never rubber-stamp; if you can't find a risk, say why the change is inherently safe (pure addition, read-only, behind a flag), don't just assert "looks fine".

Cover four points, one or two lines each:

1. **Blast radius — what it affects.** The features, flows, screens, files, and stored data this change touches, and *who* is hit: all users, one platform (Windows / Android), or only users with a precondition (feature X enabled, a custom data folder, a specific profile, a populated cache/DB). Name the concrete surface, not "the app".

2. **End-user safety.** Can it lose or corrupt user data, delete files, break a DB migration, or wedge the app on the splash screen? Is the effect **reversible** (undo, re-download, re-sync from source) or **permanent**? Anything irreversible is called out explicitly. If the change deletes or overwrites anything on disk or in the DB, this point is **mandatory**, and you must distinguish destructive-but-recoverable (e.g. re-downloadable cache) from destructive-and-permanent (e.g. the only copy of a user upload).

3. **Worst-case failure.** If the change is subtly wrong despite the tests, what does the user actually experience — cosmetic glitch → broken flow → crash → silent data loss — and how likely is that given what the tests in Phase 3 actually pin down. Be specific about which failure modes the tests do *not* cover.

4. **Bottom line.** One rating — **Low / Medium / High** risk — with a one-sentence justification, plus any "watch this in the wild" notes: edge cases left untested, platform-specific behaviour, interactions with the data folder / profile / cache / migration chain.

Keep it factual and scoped to *this* diff. The bottom-line rating goes on the `Risk:` line of the report (see above); the four points expand it underneath when the change is anything more than trivial.
